# A simple web server from scratch in Python. Run it like this:
#   python3 webserver.py  localhost  8888
# or:
#   ./webserver.py  localhost  8888
#
# The two parameters are the hostname of the server, and the port number to
# listen on. An optional third parameter specifies a the server root directory.
# - For the port number, use any number between 1024 and 49151 that is not being
#   used by another program. Port 80 would be ideal for HTTP, as it is the
#   default used by web browsers, but using port numbers below 1024 requires
#   administrator privileges. 
# - For the server hostname, using "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" will ensure that
#   your server is only accessible to browsers on your own machine, and not from
#   attackers trying to access your server from over the internet. Using an
#   ampty string "" for the server hostname would allow all connections, even
#   from outside attackers.
# - By default, files from the "./web_root" directory will be served to clients.
#   If you want to serve files from a different directory, you can specify this
#   as a third argument, for example:
#       python3 webserver.py localhost 8888 ~/Desktop/Stuff
#
# Note: This code is not "pythonic" at all; there are much more concise ways to
# write this code by using various python features like dicts and string
# interpolation. We also avoid use of any modules except for the following very
# basic things:

import os             # for file and directory stuff, like os.path.isfile()
import socket         # for socket stuff
import sys            # for sys.argv and sys.exit()
import urllib.parse   # for urllib.parse.unquote() and urllib.parse.unquote_plus()
import time           # for time of day and date functions
import threading      # for concurrent threads and locks
import random         # for random numbers
import re             # for regex split() to split up strings
import string         # for various string operations
